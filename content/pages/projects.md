For the final project, students should develop new tools, materials and activities to demonstrate the potential of digital technologies to transform schools and their local communities to vibrant learning environments that serve every student. The final projects should be grounded in what can be concretely achieved in today's progressive public schools. The Community Charter School of Cambridge (CCSC) will serve as concrete context for the design and implementation of the final projects.

Work from exemplary student projects is included below. All work is courtesy of the students named and used with permission.
